onsong-chordpro-extractor

Using Perl to extract the ChordPro versions of songs from the OnSong SQLite database. Some of the programs are experiments and tests, put the perl file in the same directory as your database file (OnSong.sqlite3) and run to extract all songs known.

EG:
cd ~/Desktop/Onsong\ backup\ folder/
chmod a+x Extract_OnSong_files_from_SQLite_DB.pl
./Extract_OnSong_files_from_SQLite_DB.pl

Always work on a backup!
